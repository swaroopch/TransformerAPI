* Transformer API
** Background

   The idea for this project comes from [[https://twitter.com/bsaeta][Brennan Saeta]] at the [[https://www.tryswift.co/events/2019/sanjose/][try! Swift San Jose 2019 conference]].

   The project is an example API server wrapping a Swift for TensorFlow model, particularly the [[https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/tree/master/Transformer][Swift for TensorFlow implementation of OpenAI's GPT-2 Transformer language model]].

** Prerequisites

   - Install [[https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#development-snapshots][latest development snapshot of Swift for TensorFlow]]

   - Install Python 3

   NOTE: This project was compiled on Ubuntu 19.04 with the nightly snapshot of Swift for TensorFlow as of [2019-06-06 Thu].

** Setup Python + Ensure Swift for TensorFlow models compile

   #+begin_src sh
# Build models
mkdir -p ~/code/swift-source
cd ~/code/swift-source
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models
cd swift-models
# https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models/blob/master/README.md#build
swift build -v -Xlinker -ltensorflow

# https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/site/tutorials/python_interoperability.ipynb
export PYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.7m.so.1.0

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install regex numpy

cd Transformer
./main 0.5 "My name is"
   #+end_src

** Serve API

   Terminal 1 : Start server

    #+begin_src sh
# Switch to this repo

cd Sources/TransformerAPI/
bash download_model.sh 117M

cd ../..
swift build
swift run TransformerAPI
    #+end_src

    Terminal 2 : Run client

    #+begin_src sh
curl http://localhost:8888/blabber -d "I'm at a conference" && echo    
    #+end_src

    Example results:
